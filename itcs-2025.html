    <p>To get to the Mudd building, first enter campus at the&nbsp;main gate at the intersection of Broadway and West 116 street. It is right next to the 116 st subway station of the 1 train. From there, walk north through campus, up&nbsp;the big staircase, and walk to the Mudd Building.</p>

    <h3>Hotels</h3>
    <p>We generally recommend staying at a hotel in the Upper West Side neighrbood of Manhattan, from which one can easily get to Columbia campus using the 1 train subway line. The station at 116 St is right next to the campus entrance gate.</p>
    <p>In the next couple of days, we will post information here for a block of rooms at the <a href="https://www.hotelbelleclaire.com/">Hotel Belleclaire</a>.</p>
    <h3>Getting to Columbia and around New York</h3>
    <p>Columbia and the Upper West Side are&nbsp;accessible by public transportation from all the NY-NJ airports&nbsp;(LGA, JFK &amp; EWR).&nbsp;The best way to get around the city is to use New York subways and buses, although&nbsp;taxis, Ubers and Lyfts are also easily available from all three airports. LGA airport is the closest of the three airports to Columbia, and the M60 bus goes directly from all the terminals at LGA airport to Columbia campus. We recommend using the Google Maps app to determine how to use public transit to get to around the city, as the system is quite large and often complicated.</p>
    <h3>Conference Information</h3>
    <p>The conference information is available at the main ITCS website:</p>
